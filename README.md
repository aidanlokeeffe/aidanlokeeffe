- 👋 Hi, I’m Aidan
- 👀 I’m interested in complex network science, connectomics, and all kinds of advanced mathematics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the field nicknamed "dynomics", where various dynamical processes are studied on recorded brain networks to understand the brain's dynamical properties.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything related to my interests
- 📫 How to reach me: aidanlokeeffe@gmail.com
