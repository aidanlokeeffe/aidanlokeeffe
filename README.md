Hello! I’m Aidan. You can reach me at aidanlokeeffe@gmail.com. My secondary email is aidanlokeeffe@utexas.edu.

I am a budding data scientist. Currently, I am working on:
  1) Wrapping up a project in which I attempted to predict the onset of sepsis in preterm infants using heart rate variability,
  2) Completeing Google's Data Analytics Certificate, and
  3) Learning survival analysis for the niche application of understanding how a network's structure relates to the survival of messages under the action of an interacting particle system.

First, let me briefly summarize my past. I graduated from UT Austin in the spring of 2021 with:
  1) A BSc in Mathematics, and
  2) The Elements of Computing Certificate, a suite of courses in Python programming and computer science.

Of all my coursework, extracurriculars, and soft skills, those most relevant to data science are:
  1) Probability, statistics, and stochastic processes,
  2) Python and R,
  3) Dynamical systems, optimization, and numerical analysis, and
  4) Independent learning, research, and presentation skills

Since graduating, I have had ecclectic experiences, namely:
  1) An NSF funded research project in the summer of 2021,
  2) Joining up with an AI consulting startup in the fall of 2021,
  3) A semester of genuine gap time in the spring of 2022,
  4) Undergraduate biology coursework in the summer of 2022,
  5) An undergraduate reserach course in the fall of 2022,
  6) Breaking my ankle (hence having a lot of time to up skill in data science) in the spring of 2023.

I feel a responsibility to those who will inherit the results of my life. We shouldn't live so wastefully and excessively that we are cursed by our descendants for having brought them into this world, yet having left them nothing. The environmental issues that have arisen with our civilization's growth have led me to pin robustness against extinction as a key principle. Yet to live out this principle to the fullest will be a monumental task. I believe that the tools of data science will be fundamental in ours and our descendants' ability to weather the challenges that come, to predict and control things larger than ourselves. 

But to actually reach a point where I can even brush a goal like this, I have to use the time I have right now to become established in data science. I plan to carry out my projects, get hired, become solid in the foundations of machine learning, and compete on Kaggle to see how I really stack up.
