Hello! My name is Aidan O'Keeffe. I am a bachelors level mathematician, adept Python programmer, and budding data scientist. The experience I have that is relevant to data science ranges between 12 and 22 months, depending on how you define what counts.

## Ongoing activities
Currently, I'm working on:
  1) Learning VBA and GIS in preparation for a job (yay!),
  2) Solidifying my knowledge of regression techniques by working through the book [_An Introduction to Statistical Learning_](https://github.com/aidanlokeeffe/intro-to-statistical-learning)

## Completed projects
If you're interested in seeing any of my completed projects, here's a list of them in reverse chronological order:
  1) [Coursework for Google Data Analytics Certificate](https://github.com/aidanlokeeffe/data-analytics-certificate), completed 1/26/2023
  2) [Analysis of Heart Rate Variability in Preterm Infants to Predict Sepsis](https://github.com/aidanlokeeffe/nicu_hrv_analysis), completed 1/19/2023.
  3) [Bevonia: Princess Knight](https://aidanlokeeffe.github.io/Bevonia-Princess-Knight/), completed 12/9/2018. This is slow to load, but it will.

## Background
I graduated from UT Austin in the spring of 2021 with:
  1) A Bachelor of Science in Mathematics, and
  2) The Elements of Computing Certificate, a suite of courses in Python programming and computer science.

Of all my coursework, extracurriculars, and soft skills, those most relevant to data science are:
  1) Probability, statistics, and stochastic processes,
  2) Python and R,
  3) Dynamical systems, optimization, and numerical analysis, and
  4) Independent learning, research, and presentation skills.

Since graduating, I have had ecclectic experiences. I've listed months of data science experience with each item.
  1) An NSF funded research project in network science in the Summer of 2021 (2 months),
  2) Joining up with an AI consulting startup in the Fall of 2021 (arguably 4 months),
  3) Bereavement and trying different approaches to the network science problem in the Spring of 2022 (arguably 4 months),
  4) [Undergraduate biology and physics coursework](https://github.com/aidanlokeeffe/summer_2022_labs) in the Summer of 2022 (arguably 1 month),
  5) An [undergraduate reserach course](https://github.com/aidanlokeeffe/nicu_hrv_analysis) in the Fall of 2022 (6 months),
  6) Breaking my ankle and using the healing time to upskill in data science, in the Spring of 2023. This includes working on [Google's Data Analytics Certificate](https://github.com/aidanlokeeffe/data-analytics-certificate) (5 months' worth, soon to be 6).

This is how I can claim that I have between 12 and 22 months of experience.

## Purpose
I have many motivations for pursuing data science. The most noble of these is a sense of responsibility to help address climate change. Like many my age, I've been steeped in warnings about climate change since my childhood, and this have given me an urge to do something about it. I believe that the tools and methods of data science will be crucial in actually solving this problems, as they enable us to understand and control things far larger than what traditional means can handle. I want to be a part of this movement.

It is invigorating to keep some higher purpose like this in mind, but it's also important (perhaps moreso) to keep one's feet on the ground and focus on what can be done right now. For me, in my current circumstances, the best bet I've got is to become established in data science.

The other motivations are achieving financial security and building a foundation for a family; you know, simple and pragmatic things that almost everyone wants.

## Miscellaneous
In my personal life, I enjoy cooking, debating, and lifting weights. I'm a fan of murder mysteries, legal dramas, and historical movies. I've recently picked up the hobby of bokashi composting; maybe once I get the hang of it, I'll start collecting data from compost batches and seeing what ingredients, temperatures, amounts of bokashi bran, physical processing methods, etc. lead to the best quality compost.
