Hello! My name is Aidan O'Keeffe. I am a bachelors level mathematician, adept Python programmer, and budding data scientist.

## Ongoing activities
Currently, I'm working on:
  1) Completeing Google's Data Analytics Certificate,
  2) Applying for data analytics jobs, and
  3) Learning survival analysis for the niche application of understanding how a network's structure relates to the survival of messages under the action of an interacting particle system.

## Completed projects
If you're interested in seeing any of my completed work, here's a list of them in reverse chronological order
  1) [Analysis of Heart Rate Variability in Preterm Infants to Predict Sepsis](https://github.com/aidanlokeeffe/nicu_hrv_analysis), completed 1/19/2023.
  2) [Bevonia: Princess Knight](https://aidanlokeeffe.github.io/Bevonia-Princess-Knight/), completed 12/9/2018. This is slow to load, but it will.

## Background
I graduated from UT Austin in the spring of 2021 with:
  1) A BSc in Mathematics, and
  2) The Elements of Computing Certificate, a suite of courses in Python programming and computer science.

Of all my coursework, extracurriculars, and soft skills, those most relevant to data science are:
  1) Probability, statistics, and stochastic processes,
  2) Python and R,
  3) Dynamical systems, optimization, and numerical analysis, and
  4) Independent learning, research, and presentation skills

Since graduating, I have had ecclectic experiences, namely:
  1) An NSF funded research project in network science in the summer of 2021,
  2) Joining up with an AI consulting startup in the fall of 2021,
  3) Bereavement and trying different approaches to the network science problem in the spring of 2022,
  4) Undergraduate biology coursework in the summer of 2022,
  5) An undergraduate reserach course in the fall of 2022,
  6) Healing from a very poorly timed ankle break and using the newly found free time to upskill as a data scientist in the spring of 2023.

I have many motivations for pursuing data science. The most noble of them is a sense of responsiblity to the people of the future. Like many people my age, I've been steeped in warnings about climate change since my childhood. From my present circumstances, the best thing I can do is develop expertise in data science, a field that allows us to understand and control things larger than us. If I gain the correct domain knowledge, then maybe someday I can implement tools for supply chain management, demand forecasting, and waste management that will help complex civilization reach a sustainable state. The other motivations are achieving financial security and building a foundation for a family.

In my personal life, I enjoy cooking, debating, and lifting weights. I'm a fan of murder mysteries, legal dramas, and historical movies. I've recently picked up the hobby of bokashi composting; maybe once I get the hang of it, I'll start collecting data from compost batches and seeing what ingredients, temperatures, amounts of bokashi bran, physical processing methods, etc. lead to the best quality compost.
