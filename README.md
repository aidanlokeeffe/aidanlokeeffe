Hello! I’m Aidan. You can reach me at aidanlokeeffe@gmail.com.

I have recently been working on an exploratory analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) in preterm neonates. At this very moment, in order of priority, I am:
  1) Refactoring the code for the HRV project so as to place it in a repository here on GitHub, and wrapping up a writeup of this project,
  2) Searching for my first full time data analytics position,
  3) Pursuing Google's Data Analytics Certificate via Coursera, and
  4) Gearing up to make another attempt at the REU project (mentioned below), the code for which I plan to publish here on GitHub in the not-too-distant future.

I graduated from UT Austin in 2021 with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics. Additionally, I snagged the Elements of Computing Certificate in the Summer of 2020. The coursework required to earn this degree and certificate covered a slew of deep, interesting topics, but the ones I think are most relevant in the world of data science are:
  - Probability, statistics, and stochastic processes,
  - Python programming and software engineering principles, and 
  - Differential equations and numerical analysis.

After graduating, I went of to HWS Colleges for the summer to work on a REU in brain network analysis. The project was to build simulations for an interacting particle system on brain networks and study the relationship between network structure and particle progeny survival times. My partner and I earned an award for a presentation of our work from the MAA and went out separate ways with ideas of how to proceed. After the REU, I joined an AI consulting start up with a friend in Canada. This is when I was really sold on AI's viability in the present. Unfortunately, the founder and I had a difference of opinion, and the result was that I left the company. 

My next lead was to try and get into gradschool. I was (and still am somewhat) interested in computational neuroscience, and I wanted to get into UChicago's program. The easiest way to qualify was to take the GRE, take some undergraduate coursework in biology and psychology, and apply. I applied in the spring of 2022 for readmision to UT, performed well on the GRE, and spent the entire summer of 2022 taking biology coursework. I also signed up for the HRV project, as I figured having some applied research under my belt would be helpful. 

Since then, concerns about the economy have shifted my focus away from earning a PhD and towards gaining experience in the workforce, and that brings us to the present.

In the future, I hope to acquire a great deal of expertise in data science. 10 years from now, I hope to be working at the forefront of this field. I like to imagine that I'll be implementing the insights of pure and applied mathematics to solve major scientific and economic problems. This is a dream that pulls me forward, but whenever it comes to mind, I have to remind myself that life is lived a moment at a time.
